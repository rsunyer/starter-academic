abstract: The mechanical properties of the living cell are intimately related to cell
  signaling biology through cytoskeletal tension. The tension borne by the cytoskeleton
  (CSK) is in part generated internally by the actomyosin machinery and externally
  by stretch. Here we studied how cytoskeletal tension is modified during stretch
  and the tensional changes undergone by the sites of cell-matrix interaction. To
  this end we developed a novel technique to map cell-matrix stresses during application
  of stretch. We found that cell-matrix stresses increased with imposition of stretch
  but dropped below baseline levels on stretch release. Inhibition of the actomyosin
  machinery resulted in a larger relative increase in CSK tension with stretch and
  in a smaller drop in tension after stretch release. Cell-matrix stress maps showed
  that the loci of cell adhesion initially bearing greater stress also exhibited larger
  drops in traction forces after stretch removal. Our results suggest that stretch
  partially disrupts the actin-myosin apparatus and the cytoskeletal structures that
  support the largest CSK tension. These findings indicate that cells use the mechanical
  energy injected by stretch to rapidly reorganize their structure and redistribute
  tension.
