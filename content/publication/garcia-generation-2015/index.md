abstract: Cellular responses to chemical cues are at the core of a myriad of fundamental
  biological processes ranging from embryonic development to cancer metastasis. Most
  of these biological processes are also influenced by mechanical cues such as the
  stiffness of the extracellular matrix. How a biological function is influenced by
  a synergy between chemical concentration and extracellular matrix stiffness is largely
  unknown, however, because no current strategy enables the integration of both types
  of cues in a single experiment. Here we present a robust microfluidic device that
  generates a stable, linear and diffusive chemical gradient over a biocompatible
  hydrogel with a well-defined stiffness gradient. Device fabrication relies on patterned
  PSA (Pressure Sensitive Adhesive) stacks that can be implemented with minimal cost
  and lab equipment. This technique is suitable for long-term observation of cell
  migration and application of traction force microscopy. We validate our device by
  testing MDCK cell scattering in response to perpendicular gradients of hepatocyte
  growth factor (HGF) and substrate stiffness.
