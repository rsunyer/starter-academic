abstract: The ability of cells to follow gradients of extracellular matrix stiffness—durotaxis—has
  been implicated in development, fibrosis, and cancer. Here, we found multicellular
  clusters that exhibited durotaxis even if isolated constituent cells did not. This
  emergent mode of directed collective cell migration applied to a variety of epithelial
  cell types, required the action of myosin motors, and originated from supracellular
  transmission of contractile physical forces. To explain the observed phenomenology,
  we developed a generalized clutch model in which local stick-slip dynamics of cell-matrix
  adhesions was integrated to the tissue level through cell-cell junctions. Collective
  durotaxis is far more efficient than single-cell durotaxis; it thus emerges as a
  robust mechanism to direct cell migration during development, wound healing, and
  collective cancer cell invasion.
