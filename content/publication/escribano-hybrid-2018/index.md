abstract: Collective cell migration is regulated by a complex set of mechanical interactions
  and cellular mechanisms. Collective migration emerges from mechanisms occurring
  at single cell level, involving processes like contraction, polymerization and depolymerization,
  of cell–cell interactions and of cell–substrate adhesion. Here, we present a computational
  framework which simulates the dynamics of this emergent behavior conditioned by
  substrates with stiffness gradients. The computational model reproduces the cell’s
  ability to move toward the stiffer part of the substrate, process known as durotaxis.
  It combines the continuous formulation of truss elements and a particle-based approach
  to simulate the dynamics of cell–matrix adhesions and cell–cell interactions. Using
  this hybrid approach, researchers can quickly create a quantitative model to understand
  the regulatory role of different mechanical conditions on the dynamics of collective
  cell migration. Our model shows that durotaxis occurs due to the ability of cells
  to deform the substrate more in the part of lower stiffness than in the stiffer
  part. This effect explains why cell collective movement is more effective than single
  cell movement in stiffness gradient conditions. In addition, we numerically evaluate
  how gradient stiffness properties, cell monolayer size and force transmission between
  cells and extracellular matrix are crucial in regulating durotaxis.
