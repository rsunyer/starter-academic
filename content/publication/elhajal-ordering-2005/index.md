abstract: The Heisenberg nearest-neighbor antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore (three-dimensional)
  lattice is highly frustrated and does not order at low temperature where spin-spin
  correlations remain short ranged. Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions (DMI’s) may
  be present in pyrochlore compounds as is shown, and the consequences of such interactions
  on the magnetic properties are investigated through mean-field approximation and
  Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that DMI’s (if present) tremendously change
  the low-temperature behavior of the system. At a temperature of the order of the
  DMI’s a phase transition to a long-range-ordered state takes place. The ordered
  magnetic structures are explicited for the different possible DMI’s which are introduced
  on the basis of symmetry arguments. The relevance of such a scenario for pyrochlore
  compounds in which an ordered magnetic structure is observed experimentally is discussed.
