abstract: The cytoskeleton (CSK) is a nonequilibrium polymer network that uses hydrolyzable
  sources of free energy such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to remodel its internal
  structure. As in inert nonequilibrium soft materials, CSK remodeling has been associated
  with structural rearrangements driven by energy-activated processes. We carry out
  particle tracking and traction microscopy measurements of alveolar epithelial cells
  at various temperatures and ATP concentrations. We provide the first experimental
  evidence that the remodeling dynamics of the CSK is driven by structural rearrangements
  over free-energy barriers induced by thermally activated forces mediated by ATP.
  The measured activation energy of these forces is approximately 40k_BT_r ( k_B being
  the Boltzmann constant and T_r being the room temperature). Our experiments provide
  clues to understand the analogy between the dynamics of the living CSK and that
  of inert nonequilibrium soft materials.
