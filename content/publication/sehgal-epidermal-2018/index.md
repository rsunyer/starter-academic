abstract: Skip to Next Section This study reports novel findings that link E-Cadherin-mediated
  force-transduction signaling to vinculin targeting to intercellular junctions via
  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and integrins. These results build on previous
  findings, which demonstrated that mechanically perturbed E-Cadherin receptors activate
  phosphoinositide-3-kinase and downstream integrins, in an EGFR-dependent manner.
  Results of this study show that this EGFR-mediated kinase cascade controls the force-dependent
  recruitment of vinculin to stressed E-Cadherin complexes--a key early signature
  of cadherin-based mechanotransduction. Vinculin targeting requires phosphorylation
  at tyrosine 822 by Abelson family kinase (Abl), but the origin of force-dependent
  Abl activation had not been identified. We now present evidence that integrin activation,
  which is downstream from EGFR signaling controls Abl activation, thus linking E-Cadherin
  to Abl through a mechanosensitive signaling network. These findings place EGFR and
  integrins at the center of a positive feedback loop, through which force-activated
  E-Cadherin signals regulate vinculin recruitment to cadherin complexes, in response
  to increased intercellular tension.
