abstract: The way cells are organized within a tissue dictates how they sense and
  respond to extracellular signals, as cues are received and interpreted based on
  expression and organization of receptors, downstream signaling proteins, and transcription
  factors. Part of this microenvironmental context is the result of forces acting
  on the cell, including forces from other cells or from the cellular substrate or
  basement membrane. However, measuring forces exerted on and by cells is difficult,
  particularly in an in vivo context, and interpreting how forces affect downstream
  cellular processes poses an even greater challenge. Here, we present a simple method
  for monitoring and analyzing forces generated from cell collectives. We demonstrate
  the ability to generate traction force data from human embryonic stem cells grown
  in large organized epithelial sheets to determine the magnitude and organization
  of cell-ECM and cell-cell forces within a self-renewing colony. We show that this
  method can be used to measure forces in a dynamic hESC system and demonstrate the
  ability to map intracolony protein localization to force organization.
