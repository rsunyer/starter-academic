abstract: The underlying mechanisms by which extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics
  influences cell and tissue function remain to be elucidated because the events associated
  with this process span size scales from tissue to molecular level. Furthermore,
  ECM has an extremely complex hierarchical 3D structure and the load distribution
  is highly dependent on the architecture and mechanical properties of ECM. In the
  present study, the macro- and microscale mechanical properties of collagen gel were
  studied. Dynamic rheological testing was performed to study the macroscale mechanical
  properties of collagen gel. The microscale mechanical properties of collagen gel
  were measured using optical magnetic twisting cytometry (OMTC). Ferromagnetic beads
  embedded in the matrix were used as mechanical probes. Our study on the multiscale
  mechanical properties of collage matrix suggests several interesting differences
  between macro and microscale mechanical properties originated from the scales of
  measurements. At the macroscopic scale, storage and loss modulus increase with collagen
  concentrations. Nonaffine collagen fibril structural network deformation plays an
  important role in determining the macroscopic mechanical properties of the collagen
  matrix. At the microscopic scale, however, the local mechanical properties are less
  sensitive to changes in collagen concentration because of the more immediate/direct
  deformation of collagen fibrils in the OMTC measurements through forces exerted
  by locally attached ferromagnetic beads. The loss modulus is more affected by the
  local interstitial fluid environment, leading to a rather dramatic increase in viscosity
  with frequency, especially at higher frequencies (textgreater10 Hz). A finite element
  model was developed to study the geometric factors in the OMTC measurements when
  the collagen matrix was considered to be hyperelastic. Our results show that the
  geometric factors are dependent on collagen concentration, or the stiffness of matrix,
  when nonlinear material properties of the matrix are considered, and thus interpretation
  of the apparent modulus from OMTC measurements should be conducted carefully.
