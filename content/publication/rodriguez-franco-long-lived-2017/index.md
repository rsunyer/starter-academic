abstract: For an organism to develop and maintain homeostasis, cell types with distinct
  functions must often be separated by physical boundaries. The formation and maintenance
  of such boundaries are commonly attributed to mechanisms restricted to the cells
  lining the boundary. Here we show that, besides these local subcellular mechanisms,
  the formation and maintenance of tissue boundaries involves long-lived, long-ranged
  mechanical events. Following contact between two epithelial monolayers expressing,
  respectively, EphB2 and its ligand ephrinB1, both monolayers exhibit oscillatory
  patterns of traction forces and intercellular stresses that tend to pull cell–matrix
  adhesions away from the boundary. With time, monolayers jam, accompanied by the
  emergence of deformation waves that propagate away from the boundary. This phenomenon
  is not specific to EphB2/ephrinB1 repulsion but is also present during the formation
  of boundaries with an inert interface and during fusion of homotypic epithelial
  layers. Our findings thus unveil a global physical mechanism that sustains tissue
  separation independently of the biochemical and mechanical features of the local
  tissue boundary.
