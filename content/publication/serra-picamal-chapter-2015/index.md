abstract: Fundamental biological processes including morphogenesis and tissue repair
  require cells to migrate collectively. In these processes, epithelial or endothelial
  cells move in a cooperative manner coupled by intercellular junctions. Ultimately,
  the movement of these multicellular systems occurs through the generation of cellular
  forces, exerted either on the substrate via focal adhesions (cell–substrate forces)
  or on neighboring cells through cell–cell junctions (cell–cell forces). Quantitative
  measurements of multicellular forces and kinematics with cellular or subcellular
  resolution have become possible only in recent years. In this chapter, we describe
  some of these techniques, which include particle image velocimetry to map cell velocities,
  traction force microscopy to map forces exerted by cells on the substrate, and monolayer
  stress microscopy to map forces within and between cells. We also describe experimental
  protocols to perform these measurements. The combination of these techniques with
  high-resolution imaging tools and molecular perturbations will lead to a better
  understanding of the mechanisms underlying collective cell migration in health and
  disease.
