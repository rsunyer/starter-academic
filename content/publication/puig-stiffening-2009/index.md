abstract: 'Background The structural integrity of the alveolar monolayer, which is
  compromised during lung inflammation, is determined by the balance between cell–cell
  and cell-matrix tethering forces and the centripetal forces owing to cell viscoelasticity
  and contraction. Dexamethasone is an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid with protective
  effects in lung injury. Aim To determine the effects of Dexamethasone on the stiffness
  and contractility of alveolar epithelial cells. Methods Cell stiffness (G′) and
  average traction exerted by the cell (T) were measured by magnetic twisting cytometry
  and by traction microscopy, respectively. A549 cells were treated 24 h with Dexamethasone
  (1 μM) or vehicle (control). G′ and T were measured before and 5 min after challenge
  with the inflammatory mediator Thrombin (0.5 U/ml). Changes induced by Dexamethasone
  in actin cytoskeleton polymerization were assessed by the fluorescent ratio between
  F-actin and G-actin obtained by staining cells with phalloidin and DNase I. Results
  Dexamethasone significantly increased G′ and T by 56% (n = 11; p textless 0.01)
  and by 80% (n = 17; p textless 0.05), respectively. Dexamethasone also increased
  F/G-actin ratio from 2.68 ± 0.07 to 2.96 ± 0.09 (n = 10; p textless 0.05). The relative
  increase in stiffness and contraction induced by Thrombin in control cells was significantly
  (p textless 0.05) reduced by Dexamethasone treatment: from 190 to 98% in G′ and
  from 318 to 105% in T. Conclusion The cytoskeleton remodelling and the increase
  in cell stiffness and contraction induced by Dexamethasone could account for its
  protective effect in the alveolar epithelium when subjected to inflammatory challenge.'
