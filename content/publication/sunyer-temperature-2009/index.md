abstract: The cytoskeleton is a complex polymer network that regulates the structural
  stability of living cells. Although the cytoskeleton plays a key role in many important
  cell functions, the mechanisms that regulate its mechanical behaviour are poorly
  understood. Potential mechanisms include the entropic elasticity of cytoskeletal
  filaments, glassy-like inelastic rearrangements of cross-linking proteins and the
  activity of contractile molecular motors that sets the tensional stress (prestress)
  borne by the cytoskeleton filaments. The contribution of these mechanisms can be
  assessed by studying how cell mechanics depends on temperature. The aim of this
  work was to elucidate the effect of temperature on cell mechanics using atomic force
  microscopy. We measured the complex shear modulus (G*) of human alveolar epithelial
  cells over a wide frequency range (0.1-25.6 Hz) at different temperatures (13-37
  degrees C). In addition, we probed cell prestress by mapping the contractile forces
  that cells exert on the substrate by means of traction microscopy. To assess the
  role of actomyosin contraction in the temperature-induced changes in G* and cell
  prestress, we inhibited the Rho kinase pathway of the myosin light chain phosphorylation
  with Y-27632. Our results show that with increasing temperature, cells become stiffer
  and more solid-like. Cell prestress also increases with temperature. Inhibiting
  actomyosin contraction attenuated the temperature dependence of G* and prestress.
  We conclude that the dependence of cell mechanics with temperature is dominated
  by the contractile activity of molecular motors.
