abstract: For an organism to develop, for a wound to heal, or for a tumor to invade,
  cells must be able to migrate following directional cues. It is widely accepted
  that directed cell migration is enabled by cellular sensing of local gradients in
  the concentration of chemical factors. The main molecular players involved in this
  mode of cellular guidance--chemotaxis--have been identified and the combination
  of modeling and experimental approaches is progressively unveiling a clear picture
  of the underlying mechanisms. Evidence obtained over the past decade has shown that
  cells can also be guided by mechanical stimuli such as physical forces or gradients
  in extracellular matrix stiffness. Mechanical guidance, which we refer here globally
  as mechanotaxis, is also thought to drive processes in development, cancer, and
  wound healing, but experimental evidence is scattered and mechanisms remain largely
  unknown. Here we use the better understood process of chemotaxis as a reference
  to define the building blocks that are required for cell guidance, and then discuss
  how these building blocks might be organized in mechanotaxis. We show that both
  chemotaxis and mechanotaxis involve an exquisite interplay between physical and
  chemical mechanisms to sense gradients, establish polarization, and drive directed
  migration.
