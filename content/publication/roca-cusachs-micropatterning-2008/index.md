abstract: Shape-dependent local differentials in cell proliferation are considered
  to be a major driving mechanism of structuring processes in vivo, such as embryogenesis,
  wound healing, and angiogenesis. However, the specific biophysical signaling by
  which changes in cell shape contribute to cell cycle regulation remains poorly understood.
  Here, we describe our study of the roles of nuclear volume and cytoskeletal mechanics
  in mediating shape control of proliferation in single endothelial cells. Micropatterned
  adhesive islands were used to independently control cell spreading and elongation.
  We show that, irrespective of elongation, nuclear volume and apparent chromatin
  decondensation of cells in G1 systematically increased with cell spreading and highly
  correlated with DNA synthesis (percent of cells in the S phase). In contrast, cell
  elongation dramatically affected the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, markedly
  reduced both cytoskeletal stiffness (measured dorsally with atomic force microscopy)
  and contractility (measured ventrally with traction microscopy), and increased mechanical
  anisotropy, without affecting either DNA synthesis or nuclear volume. Our results
  reveal that the nuclear volume in G1 is predictive of the proliferative status of
  single endothelial cells within a population, whereas cell stiffness and contractility
  are not. These findings show that the effects of cell mechanics in shape control
  of proliferation are far more complex than a linear or straightforward relationship.
  Our data are consistent with a mechanism by which spreading of cells in G1 partially
  enhances proliferation by inducing nuclear swelling and decreasing chromatin condensation,
  thereby rendering DNA more accessible to the replication machinery.
