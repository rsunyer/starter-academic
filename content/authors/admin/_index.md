bio: I am a Ramon y Cajal fellow at the University of Barcelona. My research line focusses on interrogating how individual cells and tissues sense and respond to mechanical cues and how this relates to cell and tissue migration.

My research focuses on how mechanical signals trigger directed cell migration in a wide range of biological phenomena, from development to fibrosis and metastasis. To this end, we combine biophysical techniques such as traction force microscopy, micropatterning, microfluidics, hydrogel stiffness gradients and Atomic Force Microscopy with molecular biology, advanced optical microscopy, and computational modelling.<p> Check out an introductory review to our work: </p>
